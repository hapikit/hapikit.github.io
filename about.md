This project is the evolution of several separate projects into a single cohesive toolkit for building API client SDKs.  This is an attempt to provide an alternative to the currently common approach of taking an API metadescription and using a significant amount of code generation to produce a API SDKs for different platforms.

This approach provides a set of opt-in tooling and can use a minimal amount of code generation (or none at all) to produce a more flexible and robust library to help developers consume an HTTP API.
