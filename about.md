This project is the evolution of several distinct projects into a single cohesive toolkit for building HTTP API Client SDKs.  This is an attempt to provide an alternative to the currently common approach of taking an API meta-description and using a significant amount of code generation to produce a lowest common denominator API SDK for multiple platforms.

This approach provides a set of opt-in tooling and can use a minimal amount of code generation (or none at all) to produce a more flexible and robust library to help developers consume an HTTP API.
