#Goals

The ultimate goal is to enable developers to easily build awesome client SDKs for their APIs.  

- Create HTTP requests based on API semantics
- Make testing of request creation and response handling really simple
- Easily support hypermedia APIs
- Separate implementation of API application semantics from standard HTTP semantics.
- Enable standard HTTP behaviour by assembling/configuring components
- Make it easy to implement HTTP specification compliant clients
- Allow all SDK functionality to be incrementally "opt-in" or "opt-out"
- Make it easy to mashup multiple APIs
- Provide out of the box functionality for redirection, credential management, retry handling, local caching, conditional requests, long request management
- Support building reactive clients
